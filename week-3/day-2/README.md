# Vets In Tech Web Development Course

## Week 3 Day 2

### Warm Up

- Reverse Engineering

Using warmup.html, warmup.css, and warmup.js you will be using the knowledge you've gained throughout this course to fix numerous problems with this calculator! Being a professional web-developer isn't only about being able to build beautiful carousels, it's about understanding how to navigate and overcome problems we've never encountered

1: Open warmup.html, you will see a calculator that technically works, but has some issues. Use Visual Studio Code to help you understand the entirety of this project. You will need to open the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file to understand the proceeding problems.

2: I'm sure you'll have noticed that the calculator doesn't exactly work as it's supposed to when you initially start it up. Why or what can you do to change the calculator from not displaying "Yummy Math" when you load it up?

3: If you try to use the number 5 on the keypad, you'll notice that it prints a 0 instead. Fix it!

4: I spent a bunch of time adding a background to the 0 button, but it's not working; Why or what can you do to fix this?

5: Why is the text-color dark blue? I specifically told you I hate that color more than the DMV, please change it!
